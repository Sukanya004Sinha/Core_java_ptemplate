What is collection??
collection is a group of entities represent  as a single entity
collection are introduced in java 1.2 version
Autoboxing , Generics -> because of these 2 features collections are more powerful
collection framework provides to store and manipulate the data
collection framework is haveing a group of classes and intefaces to work with the group of objects.

All the collection framework belongs to java.util package

Collection framework divide into 2 parts
collection and Map

What is the root interface of collection ?
Root interface of collection is collection

Collection is divided into 3 parts:-
1. List
2. Set 
3. Queue

Cursors-> To read the data from collection classes we have cursors
We have 3 cursors
1. Enumeration Cursors
2. Interator Cursors
3. List Iterator Cursor

Difference between Arrays and collection ??
Arrays-> Arrays can store only homogenous data.
Arrays can store  both primitive data and objects data.
Arrays is fixed in size.
In terms of memories we are not using Arrays memory wastage is there
Arrays are not supporting methods. operations become complex.
performance wise Arrays is good.
============================================================================
Collection-> Collection can store heterogenous data.
Collections can only store object data. Collections can't store primitive data.
Collections are growable in nature its can be automatically increased or decreased.
Memory wise collection is good.
Collectiosns are supporting methods. operations become easy.
performace wise collection is not too good for example if we are creating an ArrayList for n=5 
and again we need to create an arrayList of size 12 then copying one by one data will take time.
it means existing data is getting copied in new ArrayList so its taking time.

Collection vs collections


Collection is a root interface of collection framework
collections is a class that contains some methods to perform some operations
sort() nCopies()
**************Collection *********
collection is divided into 3 parts
1)List
2)Queue
3)Set

Map

Note - >the root interface of collection is collection 
Note ->the root interface of Map is Map itself
the collection framework is nothing but Java.util package
Ques- What is the parent interface of collection ??
the parent interface of the collection is Iterable

To check the predefined support for collection 
  ********* there are 2 ways to check the predefined support for collection *********
 1) Java API
 2)javap command 

javap java.util.Collection

C:\Users\sukan>javap java.util.Collection
Compiled from "Collection.java"
public interface java.util.Collection<E> extends java.lang.Iterable<E> 
{}
